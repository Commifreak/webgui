This is a utility to reset the array disk configuration so that all disks appear as "New" disks, as
if it were a fresh new server.

This is useful when you have added or removed multiple drives and wish to rebuild parity based on
the new configuration.

**DO NOT USE THIS UTILITY THINKING IT WILL REBUILD A FAILED DRIVE** - it will have the opposite
effect of making it ***impossible*** to rebuild an existing failed drive - you have been warned!
