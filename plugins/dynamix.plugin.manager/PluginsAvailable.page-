Menu="Plugins"
Title="Available Plugins"
---
Here should come an online repository of available plugins, which can be downloaded from the web
and instantly installed.

Problably this should be hosted on a wiki page of Limetech, with control over which plugins can be
displayed. This may be combined with a validation procedure to ensure that published plugins are
fully compatible with unRAID.

For the time being only manual installation of plugins exist.
