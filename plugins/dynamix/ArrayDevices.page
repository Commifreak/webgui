> **Colored Status Indicator** the significance of the color indicator at the beginning of each line in *Array Devices* is as follows:
>
> <img src='/webGui/images/green-on.png' class='icon'>Normal operation, device is active.
>
> <img src='/webGui/images/green-blink.png' class='icon'>Device is in standby mode (spun-down).
>
> <img src='/webGui/images/yellow-on.png' class='icon'>Device contents emulated.
>
> <img src='/webGui/images/red-on.png' class='icon'>Device is disabled, contents emulated.
>
> <img src='/webGui/images/blue-on.png' class='icon'>New device.
>
> <img src='/webGui/images/grey-off.png' class='icon'>No device present, position is empty.
>
> **Identification** is the *signature* that uniquely identifies a storage device. The signature
> includes the device model number, serial number, linux device id, and the device size.
>
> **Temp.** (temperature) is read directly from the device. You configure which units to use on
> the [Display Preferences](Settings/Display) page.  We do not read the temperature of spun-down hard
> drives since this typically causes them to spin up; instead we display the `*` symbol.  We also
> display the `*` symbol for SSD and Flash devices, though sometimes these devices do report a valid
> temperature, and sometimes they return the value `0`.
>
> **Size, Used, Free** reports the total device size, used space, and remaining space for files.  These
> units are also configured on the [Display Preferences](Settings/Display) page.  The
> amount of space used will be non-zero even for an empty disk due to file system overhead.
>
> *Note: for a multi-device cache pool, this data is for the entire pool as returned by btrfs.*
>
> **Reads, Writes** are a count of I/O requests sent to the device I/O drivers.  These statistics may
> be cleared at any time, refer to the Array Status section below.
>
> **Errors** counts the number of *unrecoverable* errors reported by the device
> I/O drivers. Missing data due to unrecoverable array read errors is filled in on-the-fly using parity
> reconstruct (and we attempt to write this data back to the sector(s) which failed). Any unrecoverable
> write error results in *disabling* the disk.
>
> **FS** indicates the file system detected in partition 1 of the device.
>
> **View** column contains a folder icon indicating the device is *mounted*. Click the icon to
> browse the file system.
>
> If "Display array totals" is enable on the [Display Preferences](Settings/Display) page, a
> **Total** line is included which provides a tally of the device statistics, including the average temperature
> of your devices.
>
> The Array must be Stopped in order to change Array device assignments.
>
> An unRAID array consists of a single Parity disk and a number of Data disks. The Data
> disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the Parity disk provides the redundancy necessary
> to recover from any singe disk failure.
>
> Since data is not striped across the array, the Parity disk must be as large, or larger than the largest Data
> disk.  Parity should also be your highest performance drive.
>
> Each Data disk has its own file system and can be exported as a
> separate share.
>
> Click on the Device name to configure individual device settings and launch certain utilities.

> **Slots** select the number of device slots in your server designated for Array devices.
> The minimum number of Array slots is 2, and you must have at least one device assigned to the array.
