This utility is used for troubleshooting purposes. It will collect the relevant system information and configuration files.
And store these in a single ZIP file which can be saved locally, subsequently the file can be included in your correspondance with Limetech or the unRAID forum.

This will help others to quickly get the inside information of your system and provide better support to your problem. The following information
and configuration files are collected:

+ */config*
  * copy all '*.cfg' files, 'go' file and the 'super.dat' file. These are configuration files.

+ */config/shares*
  * copy all '*.cfg' files. These are the share definition files.

+ *Syslog file*
  * copy the current 'syslog' file and copy any previous existing syslog files.

+ *Array*
  * Create disk status information about disks present in the unRAID array.

+ *SMART reports*
  * Create a SMART report of each individual disk present in your system, regardless of unRAID array usage.

<br>
Clicking **Collect** will start the collection and may open a new window to allow local saving of the zip file.
